This is a sample XAO::Web web site project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Symlink this directory as /usr/local/xao/projects/samplesite (or to
projects/ subdirectory of whatever you set to be XAO::* home):

    mkdir /usr/local/xao/projects
    ln -s `pwd` /usr/local/xao/projects/

Try:

    make

    make dist

    make test

Check content of the files, most of them have useful comments.

Apache configuration should look something like:

<VirtualHost samplesite.com:80>
  ServerName samplesite.com

  <Directory /usr/local/xao/handlers>
    Options ExecCGI FollowSymLinks
    SetHandler cgi-script
  </Directory>

  RewriteEngine on
  RewriteRule   ^/(.*)$  \
                /usr/local/xao/handlers/xao-apache.pl/samplesite/$1  \
                [L]
</VirtualHost>

Read XAO::Web::Intro man page and related man pages and documents,
experiment with templates and have fun building your first XAO::Web
site.

If you're willing to contribute better documentation or a HOW-TO as you
go along -- you are more than welcome.
